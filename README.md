# NixOS organization

An entrypoint to help you navigate the official ecosystem. Who owns what, what resources exist, ...

## How to make changes

Anybody can propose changes with PRs, or open issues to have discussions.

The `README.md` file is automatically generated from the [`data.nix`](./data.nix) file,
so open PRs against that instead.

You can test your changes locally using
```
nix run .#checkReadme
```

The person merging PRs will ensure that the change is implemented, either automatically or manually.
